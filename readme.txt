The name of this project is "Work Out App". This was made by Team 08 of class CS 3443-003. The team members include Mahnoor Bokhari, Angelo Middleton, Kevin Garcia, Eric Por, and Austine Augustine.

Description: This app has 2 main functionalities: planning workouts and creating and managing a list of recipes.

Known bugs: Whenever you press the "add" button while leaving the "Recipe Name" and "Recipe Link" textfields empty, it empties both of the ListViews, and the "Show All Recipes" button does not work. If you add another recipe name and recipe link and then press "Add" again, this problem is fixed.
If you press "Remove" while there are no recipes in the text file, you will receive an error. This is fixed if you add another recipe, select it, then press the "Remove" button.

The intended function of tracker was for calendar to be incorporated into it with the workout and tracker. Where the user would enter a clickable calendar date, then proceed to the next area which would open the workout.java allowing the user to enter the data by adding and removing workouts.
