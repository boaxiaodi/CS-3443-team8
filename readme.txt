The name of this project is "Work Out App". This was made by Team 08 of class CS 3443-003. The team members include Mahnoor Bokhari, Angelo Middleton, Kevin Garcia, Eric Por, and Austine Augustine.

Description: This app has 2 main functionalities: planning workouts and creating and managing a list of recipes.

The user will be prompted to a menu on app execution with a welcome page to the app, then they will have the options presented to go from the differing screens such as the home screen, tracker screen, and the recipe screen.

The recipe screen will have several options presented where the user will need to input the Recipe Name, and Recipe link to add new data to the internal list which tracks the recipes in total that the user has entered after pressing the furthest most right button, "add". The text field under search recipes allows the user to search for a particular item if they use the Recipe Name to search for said item. Show All Recipes does as intended and displays the list of the the recipes including its link in the list view. And as for the remove, this removes an item from the list that the user has clicked which will be highlighted and then removed after pressing remove.

The Tracker button will display a calendar and a new workout button, the new workout button will open the workout.fxml and display said field in the open space below allowing the user to input data such as the workout, the reps, and the sets(basicvally add workout). This would be displayed in the list view below if the user clicks view workout. The remove workout button removes a workout that the user has clicked which will be highlighted. 

Known bugs: Whenever you press the "add" button while leaving the "Recipe Name" and "Recipe Link" textfields empty, it empties both of the ListViews, and the "Show All Recipes" button does not work. If you add another recipe name and recipe link and then press "Add" again, this problem is fixed.
If you press "Remove" while there are no recipes in the text file, you will receive an error. This is fixed if you add another recipe, select it, then press the "Remove" button.

The intended function of tracker was for calendar to be incorporated into it with the workout and tracker. Where the user would enter a clickable calendar date, then proceed to the next area which would open the workout.java allowing the user to enter the data by adding and removing workouts.
